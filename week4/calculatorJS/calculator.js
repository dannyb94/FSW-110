/*
For this project, you are going to create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, and multiply.

Requirements:

You will have one section (<div>) for each math operation (so 3 sections) total
Each section has two inputs to take the first and second numbers
Each section will have a button to perform the operation
You will inject the result into the HTML (not an alert)
Your website will have 3 colors
Your website will have proper padding/spacing to lay things out nicely.
** Forms are covered in the next week, so for this you will use <input /> tags, give them an “id”, and use click events to capture the values and append the appropriate output to the DOM.
